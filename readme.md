I'm trying to write a program that can figure out how you're wrong on a question.

To use: python lexer.py to play around with the lexer, python tutor.py to play around with the program. It recognizes +*-() and can identify operator and (subtraction)-associativity errors. 

To test: python -m unittest discover
