Here's how i want this to be after I'm done refactoring. The directory should look like this:

/tutor

tutor.py - holds the core code, the tutor class, to be run as main
{interface.py?} - To use the tutor, maybe?

/tutor/lexers

tokens.py - List of tokens. May or may not contain the token groups.
lexer.py -  Takes a string and turns it into a list of tokens.
eqntree.py - Takes a tokenlist and breaks it down into nested tuples. For example:

[6, PLUS, 6, MINUS, 6] -> (MINUS, (PLUS, 6, 6), 6) 

/tutor/errors

errortools.py - stuff like cut, build tree
human.py - ways of doing operations that reflect human thinking, like carrying
{name}error.py - specific error packs, e.x. operatorerrors.py
errorpacks.py - tutor calls this, not the error packs themselves. This is the hub.

/tutor/test

One test per other file.
